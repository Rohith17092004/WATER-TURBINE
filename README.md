##  Working Principle

- Based on **Bernoulli's Principle** and **fluid dynamics**.
- Water flow hits the turbine blades, converting kinetic energy to mechanical rotation.
- The DC motor converts this mechanical energy into electrical energy.
- The LED lights up as a demonstration of the energy conversion.

##  Construction Steps

###  Step 1: Blade Assembly
- Glue ice cream sticks to bottle caps to form turbine blades.

###  Step 2: Rotor Mounting
- Insert a thin rod through the center of the turbine blades and fix it securely.

###  Step 3: Mounting
- Mount the rod on a stable stand allowing free rotation.

###  Step 4: Water Flow
- Direct a stream of water over the blades.
- Collect water in a bucket or tub below.

###  Step 5: Measurement (Optional)
- Use a manometer to measure pressure/velocity of water.

###  Step 6: Energy Generation
- Connect rod to a DC motor.
- Attach an LED bulb to visualize power generation.
